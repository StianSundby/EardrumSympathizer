# EardrumSympathizer

A background process that attempts to recognize new applications that has been started from Steam, Origin, Epic Games Launcher, Battle Net or any of (way too many) game launchers, and then checks if this is the first time this application has ran on your computer - it then lowers the volume in the Windows Volume Mixer to 10%, in an attempt to save your eardrums from the often default setting of 100% Master Volume.

**I never actually managed to get this to work.**     
 But I will hopefully pick it back up in the future.     
 Where I ran into issues was with Windows not being cooporative in letting me check the registry, and changing system settings.
